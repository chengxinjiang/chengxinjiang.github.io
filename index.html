I am a broadly-trained seismologist to employ seismic imaging tools and numerical simulations to study tectonic, magmatic and near surface geological processes. My recent research focus on 1) illuminating fine-scale anisotropic structures beneath the Cascadia subduction zone and continental U.S. to understand lithosphere deformation, 2) monitoring volcanic and groundwater processes in California with seismic noise and 3) modelling ground shaking in the metropolitan basin beneath Tokyo. Author of 10 publications, with 7 as a leading author.
